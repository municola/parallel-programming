Questions
--------------
a) 	Lets say Thread A wants to update its Data, but 10000000 other threads with an older timestamp than A
	also want to update. A always is to slow. So A doesnt make progress till these 100000000 Threads have
	updated. For this scenario our code isn't wait-free
	=> Not wait-free
	
b) 	Yes. And we can use the same mechanism!
